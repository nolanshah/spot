# bloop

bloop is like [blot](https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot) but on rails. Bloop turns a folder into a static website. It can convert docx, md, pynb, txt, latex, rtf, and really any other format supported by pandoc into html. It's suitable for a blog, docsite, or whatever you want, but it only generates html -- how and where you host it is up to you.
